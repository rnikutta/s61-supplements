"""Routines for (some) computations performed in Agliozzo et al. (2016), MNRAS, [TODO: insert final DOI here]

   Routines for MCMC samling and Bayesian inference, etc.

   Some of these routines require that you have rhocube.py and
   models.py present in the same directory.

   Get RHOCUBE from github:

     https://github.com/rnikutta/rhocube/

   or best clone directly:

     git clone https://github.com/rnikutta/rhocube
